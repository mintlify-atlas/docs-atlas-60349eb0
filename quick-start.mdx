description: Get a working Northwestern Laravel Starter application up and running in minutes
---

This guide will help you go from a fresh installation to a fully functional application with authentication, user management, and API capabilities.

<Note>
  Make sure you've completed the [installation](/installation) steps before proceeding.
</Note>

## Start the Development Server

The starter kit includes a convenient `dev` script that starts all necessary services in parallel:

```bash
composer dev
```

This command starts:
- **Laravel development server** on `http://localhost:8000`
- **Queue worker** to process background jobs
- **Laravel Pail** for real-time log tailing
- **Vite development server** for frontend asset compilation

Alternatively, you can start services individually:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Laravel Server
php artisan serve
```

```bash Queue Worker
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
```

```bash Vite (Frontend)
pnpm run dev
```

```bash Logs
php artisan pail --timeout=0
```
</CodeGroup>

## Access the Application

Once the development server is running, visit:

- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin

## Create Your First User

You have several options to create users:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local Authentication">
    If `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true` in your `.env` file, you can create a local user via Artisan:

    ```bash
    php artisan tinker
    ```

    Then in the Tinker console:

    ```php
    use App\Domains\User\Actions\Local\CreateLocalUser;
    use App\Domains\User\Models\User;

    $user = app(CreateLocalUser::class)->execute(
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        email: 'john.doe@northwestern.edu',
        username: 'jdoe'
    );
    ```

    <Note>
      Local authentication uses passwordless email verification codes. When you attempt to log in, a verification code will be sent to the email address (or logged in development).
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Database Seeder">
    The starter includes seeders that create sample users:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

    This creates:
    - A super administrator user
    - Sample users with various roles
    - Default roles and permissions
    - Sample API tokens
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Northwestern Directory">
    If you have Directory Search API access, users can be auto-provisioned on first login:

    ```bash .env
    DIRECTORY_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    When a Northwestern user logs in via Entra ID SSO, their account will be automatically created and synchronized with Directory data.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assign Super Administrator Role

To make a user a super administrator, use the built-in command:

```bash
php artisan user:make-admin {netid}
```

Or configure super admins in your `.env` file (they'll be assigned the role automatically):

```bash .env
SUPER_ADMIN_NETIDS=abc123,xyz789
```

## Explore the Admin Panel

Log in to the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin to access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Management">
    Navigate to **Users** to view, create, edit, and manage user accounts.
    
    Features:
    - User search and filtering
    - Bulk operations
    - Role assignment
    - User impersonation
    - Login history
  </Step>

  <Step title="Roles & Permissions">
    Navigate to **Roles** to manage your RBAC system.
    
    Default roles:
    - **Super Administrator** - Full system access
    - **Administrator** - Standard admin access
    - **User** - Basic user access
    
    Create custom roles and assign specific permissions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Access Tokens">
    If `API_ENABLED=true`, navigate to **API** > **Access Tokens** to manage API authentication.
    
    Features:
    - Create tokens with custom expiration
    - CIDR-based IP restrictions
    - Token rotation
    - Automatic expiration notifications
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Request Logs">
    Navigate to **API** > **Request Logs** to view API analytics.
    
    Metrics include:
    - Request volume over time
    - Response time distribution
    - Success/failure rates
    - Top endpoints
    - Filter by token, endpoint, status, or date range
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Logs">
    Navigate to **Audit** to view the complete audit trail.
    
    Every model change is logged with:
    - Before/after values
    - User who made the change
    - Timestamp
    - IP address and user agent
    - Request trace ID
  </Step>

  <Step title="Login Records">
    Navigate to **Security** > **Login Records** to monitor authentication activity.
    
    Track:
    - Successful logins
    - Failed login attempts
    - Login method (SSO, token, email code)
    - IP addresses and locations
    - User agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test the API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API Token">
    In the admin panel, navigate to **API** > **Access Tokens** and create a new token:
    
    1. Click **New Access Token**
    2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Development Testing")
    3. Set an expiration date (or leave blank for no expiration)
    4. Optionally add IP restrictions in CIDR format
    5. Click **Create**
    
    <Warning>
      Copy the token immediately after creation - it cannot be retrieved later!
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make an API Request">
    Test the API with a simple request:
    
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
         http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users
    ```
    
    The API follows RESTful conventions and returns JSON responses:
    
    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "net_id": "abc123",
          "first_name": "John",
          "last_name": "Doe",
          "email": "john.doe@northwestern.edu",
          "created_at": "2026-02-28T12:00:00.000000Z",
          "updated_at": "2026-02-28T12:00:00.000000Z"
        }
      ],
      "links": {...},
      "meta": {...}
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Request Logs">
    Return to the admin panel and navigate to **API** > **Request Logs** to see your request logged with:
    
    - Endpoint and HTTP method
    - Response status code
    - Response time in milliseconds
    - Request and response payloads
    - Token used for authentication
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test User Impersonation

User impersonation allows administrators to troubleshoot issues by viewing the application as another user:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Users">
    In the admin panel, go to **Users** and find the user you want to impersonate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Impersonation">
    Click the three-dot menu on the user row and select **Impersonate**.
    
    You'll be redirected to the application as that user, with a banner indicating you're impersonating.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop Impersonation">
    Click **Stop Impersonating** in the banner to return to your own account.
    
    All impersonation sessions are logged in the `impersonation_logs` table for security auditing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Impersonation is a powerful feature. Ensure only trusted administrators have the `impersonate users` permission.
</Warning>

## Run the Test Suite

Verify everything is working by running the test suite:

<CodeGroup>
```bash PHPUnit (Parallel)
php artisan test --parallel
```

```bash PHPUnit (Sequential)
php artisan test
```

```bash Cypress (Interactive)
pnpm run test:e2e
```

```bash Cypress (Headless)
pnpm run test:e2e:headless
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The test suite uses the `DB_PHPUNIT_DATABASE` database defined in your `.env` file to avoid affecting your development data.
</Note>
