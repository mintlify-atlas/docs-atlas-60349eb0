## Welcome to Northwestern Laravel Starter

A production-ready Laravel starter kit that provides everything you need to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications or fully API-driven services at Northwestern University.

Modern web development involves far more than building routes, controllers, and views. Before any business logic can take shape, teams must establish authentication flows, authorization layers, API conventions, auditing, CI/CD pipelines, frontend patterns, monitoring, and a maintainable project structure. These foundational concerns are essential, yet they consume significant time and often lead to duplicated effort across projects.

The Northwestern Laravel Starter provides a cohesive solution that takes care of this baseline work up front. It offers a production-ready architecture so development can begin with real features instead of infrastructure setup.

<Note>
  This starter kit is designed primarily for applications built within Northwestern University's ecosystem. If you're outside Northwestern, you may not be able to use the project as-is. However, the architecture, patterns, and modules implemented here may still be valuable as reference material or inspiration.
