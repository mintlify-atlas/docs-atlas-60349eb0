The Northwestern Laravel Starter provides a comprehensive frontend solution that combines modern web technologies with Northwestern University's branding guidelines. The frontend is built with accessibility, responsive design, and maintainability in mind.

## Frontend Stack

The application uses a hybrid approach, combining different technologies based on the use case:

## Key Technologies

### Filament Administration Panel

The admin interface is powered by [Filament v3](https://filamentphp.com/), a modern Laravel admin panel that provides:

- **Resources**: Pre-built CRUD interfaces for managing users, roles, audits, and more
- **Pages**: Custom dashboard pages with widgets and analytics
- **Widgets**: Reusable components for displaying data and metrics
- **Tables**: Advanced data tables with filtering, sorting, and bulk actions
- **Forms**: Dynamic form builders with validation and field types

See the [Filament Admin Panel](/frontend/filament-admin) documentation for details.

### Bootstrap 5

Bootstrap 5.3.8 provides the foundation for responsive layouts and components:

```json
"bootstrap": "^5.3.8"
```

The framework is customized with Northwestern's brand colors, typography, and design patterns.

### Build Tools

The frontend build process uses modern tooling:

- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized production builds
- **SASS**: CSS preprocessing with Northwestern theme variables
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for enhanced development
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework for interactive components

## Directory Structure

The frontend assets are organized in the following structure:

```
resources/
├── css/
│   └── filament/
│       └── administration/
│           └── theme.css          # Filament theme customization
├── sass/
│   ├── _variables.scss            # Northwestern color variables
│   ├── app.scss                   # Main application styles
│   ├── nu_fonts.scss              # Northwestern typography
│   ├── nu_purple_layout.scss      # Northwestern branding styles
│   └── social_icons.scss          # Social media icons
├── views/
│   ├── auth/                      # Authentication pages
│   ├── components/                # Reusable Blade components
│   └── filament/                  # Filament view customizations
└── js/
    └── app.ts                     # Main JavaScript entry point
```

## Filament Structure

The Filament admin panel code is organized in the `app/Filament/` directory:

```
app/Filament/
├── Clusters/                      # Grouped navigation sections
│   └── ApiCluster/               # API-related pages cluster
├── Exports/                       # Data export configurations
├── Navigation/                    # Custom navigation groups
├── Pages/                         # Custom dashboard pages
├── Resources/                     # CRUD resources
│   ├── AccessTokens/
│   ├── ApiRequestLogs/
│   ├── Audits/
│   ├── Roles/
│   ├── SupportTickets/
│   ├── UserLoginRecords/
│   └── Users/
└── Widgets/                       # Dashboard widgets
```

Each resource includes:

- **Resource class**: Defines the model, navigation, and configuration
- **Pages**: List, create, edit, and view pages
- **Tables**: Table configuration with columns, filters, and actions
- **Schemas**: Form and infolist schemas
- **Widgets**: Resource-specific dashboard widgets

## Northwestern Branding

The application follows Northwestern University's visual identity guidelines:

- **Primary Color**: Northwestern Purple (`#4E2A84`)
- **Typography**: Akkurat Pro for body text, with brand-compliant font families
- **Lockup**: Northwestern wordmark and logo implementation
- **Footer**: Standardized footer with office contact information

See the [Northwestern Theme](/frontend/northwestern-theme) documentation for customization options.

## Responsive Design

All frontend components are built with mobile-first responsive design:

- Fluid grid system using Bootstrap breakpoints
- Mobile-optimized navigation and forms
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Responsive data tables with horizontal scrolling on small screens

## Performance

The frontend is optimized for performance:

- **Asset bundling**: Vite bundles and minifies CSS and JavaScript
- **Code splitting**: Lazy loading for improved initial load times
- **Optimized images**: Proper sizing and compression for Northwestern logos
- **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets
